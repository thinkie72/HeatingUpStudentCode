| January 14 | 8:35-9:05pm | I was really lost, so I thought about a lot of different possibilities, but settled on making an array to hold the lengths, starting at 1. After each find of an increased temperature, you add the updated run length to the prior elements. I'm still not sure how I'm going to find the best run length at the end... |

But in class I began thinking about faster ways to solve this problem, mostly to no avail. I was mostly thinking about speedups to the current algorithm. |

I implemented this one to slightly decrease the runtime by calculating the longest run more efficiently. I have an idea to back fill to improve that I'll try next. |
